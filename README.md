# ECBC-Data-2023
Ethical Consumption Before Capitalism, Data+ 2023

Hello, we are the ECBC Data+ 2023 Cohort! In this repository, you will find all relevant code that was used to conduct our analysis this summer. 

# 2022 relevant files (folder) 
* *replace.ipynb* standardizes and lemmatizes files using provided .txt file dictionaries. We ended up not using all of this code, though it provided some useful functionality for our lemmatization code
* *text.py* extracts texts from XML files provided by EP that are already partially standardized and lemmatized, deals with the "lemma" specifications put in by EP
